# OPEN CODE COMPONENTS (B2B Commerce)

This repository provides the source code for selected components from the B2B Commerce Storefront, made available as "Open Code Components." These components can be customized and extended to meet the specific needs of your storefront. You can enhance them as required and deploy the updated versions in any B2B Storefront by following the steps outlined below.

## Prerequisites üóíÔ∏è
* Enable the ExperienceBundle Metadata API for Digital Experiences.
  * This is typically enabled by default; to verify the setting, login to your org and go to **Setup** ‚Üí **Digital Experiences**. Under ‚ÄúDigital Experiences‚Äù, go to Settings and then select the checkbox ‚ÄúEnable ExperienceBundle Metadata API‚Äù. <img width="1547" height="910" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-04 at 11 59 38‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0243481b-e50a-403b-a228-b8761b88be4d" />

* Install SF CLI (a.k.a. SFDX) locally

* 

## Steps to use Open Code Components

1. Go to your sfdx project and in case not already created, then please create a new SFDX project and connect it to your SF org using the sfdx auth command, like this:

   ```console 
   sf org login web --alias "alias" --instance-url "ORG-BASE-URL"
   ```

2. After this, execute the below command to retrieve all the digital experiences:
   ```console
   sf project retrieve start --metadata DigitalExperienceBundle --target-org "alias"
   ```
  > [!TIP]
  > If this command does not work from your terminal:
  > ```console
  > sf project retrieve start -m DigitalExperienceBundle -o "alias"
  > ```

3. Next, navigate to the specific storefront where you want to deploy the Open Code Component. Within the storefront‚Äôs folder structure (typically under `digitalExperiences`), you‚Äôll find directories named `sfdc_cms__lwc` and `sfdc_cms__label`. These same folders are also present in this repository. To incorporate the Open Code component(s), simply copy the components (along with their dependencies) from the corresponding `sfdc_cms__lwc` and `sfdc_cms__label` folders in this repo into the matching folders in your target storefront. 

4. Proceed with making the necessary enhancements to the component as per your requirements. Once the changes are complete, use the following command to deploy the updated components to your storefront:
   ```console
   sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/digitalExperiences/site/<name_of_store>/sfdc_cms__lwc/<name_of_component>  --target-org <org_alias_name>
   ```

5. Once the deployment is complete, navigate to your SF org and open the Experience Builder for the storefront where the components were deployed. You‚Äôll notice a new section in the Palette named "Open Code" (shown below), which shows the newly-deeployed Open Code components for the experience. Replace the existing components in your storefront with the enhanced versions from the Open Code section. <img width="967" height="557" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-25 at 12 10 08‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81705582-a38f-429c-91c5-445393136add" />
